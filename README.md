# GetHubby
Code Institute User Centric Frontend Develtopment Milestone Project One

This is an imagined dating site for developers and specificially geared towards users of GitHub leveraging the existing social & community aspects of same. The goal is to have a site which appeals to developers by using industry lingo and to allow users to sign-up via existing, commonly used, industry tools (e.g. GitHub).

## UX
 
The site is intended to be simple and minimalistic while also colourful and fun. The information should be short and to the point but with a light-hearted tone where appropriate. Text should use industry terminology to present an industry-specific focus.

User Stories:
- As a single person, I want a modern and appealing site which is simple to navigate.
- As a developer, I want a site that caters to my interests and is clearly aimed at people like me.
- As a modern user, I want a mobile-friendly site that looks as good on small screens as large.


## Features

The navbar is responsive and will switch to a hamburger menu on small screens. 

The hero section contains an eye-catching jumbotron slideshow with images of a variety of possible users of site. A mock-typing animation was added to the text overlayed on the slideshow to suggest a relation to coding (and more specifically GitHub commands).

On med & large screens the about section contains simple, colourful flip-cards with a short title (and icons representing the theme of the title) on the front and a short summary of the feature in question on the back. One small screens the flip cards are replaced by a collapsing list.

The testimonials section shows a circular image of imagined couples beside a short quote from each couple. The button beneath each quote opens a mock Q&A with the couple (bootstrap-modal on larger screens, bootstrap-collapse on smaller screens).

The contribute section links to this GitHub rep. The sign-up section is made to look like a code-editor window with mock-HTML text.


 
### Existing Features
- Carousel with typing animation overlaid
- Links to relavant sections with smooth scroll
- Flip-cards
- Modal/Collapse for couple Q&As depending on screen size
- Buttons display a popout icon relating to the content/target of said button.
- On large screens there is an arrow icon with hover.css effect to highlight that additional content is below and links to the next section.

+++For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

+++In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement


## Technologies Used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** framework to simplify the initial layout and include advanced features such as the jumbotron and carousel.
- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - The project uses the **Hover.css** collection to add appealing animations to icons & buttons.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome** for attractive and simple icons.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The project uses **Google Fonts** for custom typefaces.

## Testing

The site has been developed using the mobile first approach with multiple media queries for larger screen sizes. All changes to the site were tested in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers
+++In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

+++Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

+++For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

+++1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

+++In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

+++You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

+++If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

+++This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

+++In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

+++In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
