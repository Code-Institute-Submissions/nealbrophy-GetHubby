# GetHubby
Code Institute User Centric Frontend Develtopment Milestone Project One

This is an imagined dating site for developers and specificially geared towards users of GitHub leveraging the existing social & community aspects of same. The goal is to have a site which appeals to developers by using industry lingo and to allow users to sign-up via existing, commonly used, industry tools (e.g. GitHub, StackOverflow etc)

 
## UX
 
The site is intended to be simple and minimalistic while also colourful and fun. The information should be short and to the point but with a light-hearted tone where appropriate. Text should use industry terminology to present an industry-specific focus.

User Stories:
- As a single person, I want to a dating site which is....
- As a developer, I want to a site which is....
- As a single developer, I want to....

++++This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.+++

## Features

+++///In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.+++
 
### Existing Features
- Carousel with smooth animation and appealing appearance
- Links to relavant sections with smooth scroll
- Animated post-its

+++For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

+++In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Have jumbotron overlay colors change randomly instead of repeating

## Technologies Used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** framework to simplify the initial layout and include advanced features such as the jumbotron and carousel.
- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - The project uses the **Hover.css** collection to add appealing animations to icons & buttons.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome** for attractive and simple icons.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The project uses **Google Fonts** for custom typefaces.

## Testing

+++In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

+++Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

+++For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

+++1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

+++In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

+++You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

+++If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

+++This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

+++In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

+++In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
